To see the number of rows and column in the dataframe, we use "shape" attribute of the dataframe object.
We can access the names of columns of dataframe object, through "columns" attribute of the dataframe object.
NaN values are Not a Number values are blank cells or cells that contain strings instead of numbers.
We can check the NaN data through "isna()" method.
It lists down the data in the form of True and False.
The cell in which there is True, then it contains "NaN" values.
We use "dropna()" method on the dataframe to drop the rows with NaN values.
We create a clean dataframe on the basis of it.
To access a particular column on the dataframe, we can use square bracket notation.
To find the maximum value in a particular column, we can use max() method.
"idxmax()" method is used to get the index of the row in which the selected column is at its highest.
We can use "loc" property to select the row and column on the basis of the index.
syntax:- loc[index].
Quantile is a statistical concept that often represents a value below than the certain proportion of the data.
sort_values() method is used to sort the data of dataframe on the basis of a certain column.
It creates a new dataframe with the sorted data.
NOTE:- If I am interested or want to know the data of a certain columns.
We can use the list and pass the name of the required columns in it as its elements.
"groupby()" method is used to group the rows on the basis of a certain categories/groups.
syntax:- df.groupby("name_of_group") gives me groupby object.
To view how many elements, it has under it, you need to use count() method on it.
NOTE:- pd.options.display.float_format = '{:,.2f}'.format 
Here, pd.options.display.float_format is a pandas option that controls the floating point number formatting 
in the dataframe output.
{:,.2f} represents ":" beginning of the format specifier, "," represents the value should be thousands separated.
".2f" represents only two digits are allowed after the decimal point.
